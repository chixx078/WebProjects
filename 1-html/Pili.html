    <h3>Glove Puppetry</h3>
    <p>Glove puppetry (Chinese: 布袋戲; pinyin: bùdàixì) is a type of opera using cloth puppets that originated during the 17th century in Quanzhou or Zhangzhou of China's Fujian province, and historically practised in the Min Nan-speaking areas such as Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, the Chaoshan region of Guangdong, and other parts of southern China. It had since established itself more firmly and contemporarily as a popular art form in Taiwan.</p>

    <p>The puppet's head uses wood carved into the shape of a hollow human head, but aside from the head, palms, and feet, which are made of wood, the puppet's torso and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. At the time of the performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and makes it perform. In previous years the puppets used in this type of performance strongly resembled "cloth sacks," hence the name, which literally means "cloth bag opera."</p>

    <h3>Pili (TV series)</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.pili.com.tw/">Pili</a> (Traditional Chinese: 霹靂, Pe̍h-oē-jī: Phek-le̍k, literally: "thunderbolt") is a glove puppetry show from Taiwan. It is made by Pili International Multimedia. The TV series debuted in 1985, and it still continues today. It is one of the most popular TV shows in Taiwan.[citation needed] Unlike traditional puppet shows, Pili uses computer generated imagery (CGI) during action sequences. The delicate design of the appearance and characteristics of each puppet has made Pili a well-known TV series in Taiwan.</p>
